.PHONY: up down logs migrate-db

## Start the API container (build if needed)
up:
	docker-compose up --build -d

## Stop the API container
down:
	docker-compose down

## Stream container logs
logs:
	docker-compose logs -f api

## Migrate an existing ./chat_history.db bind-mount file into the named volume.
##
## Run this ONCE if you previously ran the container with the old bind-mount
## (./chat_history.db:/app/chat_history.db) and want to preserve your data
## after upgrading to the named-volume configuration (chat_history_data).
##
## Steps performed:
##   1. Create the volume by starting the service (if not already running)
##   2. Copy ./chat_history.db from the host into the chat_history_data volume
##   3. Restart the container so it picks up the migrated file
